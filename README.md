   ```

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Update the `.env` file with your bot token, role IDs, and MongoDB URI

```

### Migrating from JSON (if upgrading)

If you have existing JSON data, use the migration script:

## Troubleshooting

### "Unknown Integration" Error for Slash Commands

If slash commands show "Unknown integration":

1. **Check Bot Permissions**: Ensure the bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission
2. **Reinvite Bot**: Use this URL format to reinvite with proper permissions:
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
   ```
3. **Wait for Sync**: Commands may take up to 1 hour to appear globally
4. **Check Logs**: Look for "Successfully synced X commands" in the logs

### Command Registration Issues

- Commands are registered as hybrid commands (both text and slash)
- Text commands work immediately with `R!` prefix
- Slash commands require Discord sync (may take time)
- Check bot logs for sync status

## Funny Status Messages

The bot cycles through humorous status messages every 2 minutes, including:
- "Watching over {users} Riko Simps"
- "Listening to Rayen's New Proposals"
- "Watching Angel be mad at Taishi"
- "Listening to random people yap in DMs"
- "Watching new messages & ideas pile up"
- And many more hilarious statuses!

## Configuration

The bot is configured for:
- **Guild ID**: 1278117138909102170
- **Banned Role ID**: 1378693499540471838 (users with this role cannot get restricted role)
- **Restricted Role ID**: 1378691142819909853 (role that banned users cannot access)
- **Text Command Prefix**: `R!` (e.g., `R!uptime`)
- **Slash Commands**: Available as `/command` (e.g., `/uptime`)

## Docker Benefits

- **Consistent Environment**: Same runtime across all systems
- **Easy Deployment**: One command to start the bot
- **Resource Management**: Built-in memory and CPU limits
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic restart if bot crashes
- **Log Management**: Structured logging with rotation
